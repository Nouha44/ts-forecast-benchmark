# 📈 Time Series Forecasting Benchmark (Prophet, SARIMA, LSTM, TimesFM)

This project compares traditional statistical models (**Prophet** & **SARIMA**) with deep learning (**LSTM**) and a zero-shot foundation model (**TimesFM** by Google) on a synthetic, seasonal sales dataset.

---

## 🔍 Goal

Help businesses choose the right time series forecasting approach depending on:

- 📊 Forecasting accuracy  
- ⚙️ Model complexity  
- 📉 Data availability  
- 🖥️ Deployment constraints

## 🧪 Models Compared

| Model    | Type             | Pre-training     | MAE   | RMSE  |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------|-------|
| SARIMA   | Statistical       | ❌                | XX    | XX    |
| Prophet  | Statistical       | ❌                | XX    | XX    |
| LSTM     | Deep Learning     | ❌ (trained)      | ✅     | ✅     |
| TimesFM  | Foundation Model  | ✅                | ✅     | ✅     |

✅ = best performance in test set
